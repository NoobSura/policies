Return and Exchange Policy:

At Cobblo, we take pride in creating handmade leather products of exceptional quality. We strive to ensure that our customers are completely satisfied with their purchases. However, we understand that there may be instances where you might need to cancel an order, return a product, or request an exchange. To provide you with a seamless shopping experience, we have established the following Return and Exchange Policy:

Cancellation:
You have the option to cancel your order within 4-5 hours of placing it. To request a cancellation, please contact our customer support team as soon as possible. If the cancellation is made within the specified timeframe, we will initiate a refund to your account within 48 hours. Please note that the refund will be processed after deducting any applicable bank charges.

Return and Refund:
If you receive a damaged product due to delivery mishandling, we apologize for the inconvenience caused. In such cases, please reach out to our customer support team within 48 hours of receiving the product, providing detailed information about the damage. We will arrange for a replacement of the damaged item free of charge. 

In the event that you wish to return a product for reasons other than damage, please contact our customer support team within 7 days of receiving the item. To be eligible for a return, the product must be unused, in its original condition, and with all tags and packaging intact. Once we receive the returned item, our quality control team will inspect it to ensure it meets the return criteria. If approved, a refund will be initiated to your account within 3-5 working days.

Exchange:
We currently do not offer direct exchanges. If you would like to exchange a product for a different size, color, or style, we kindly ask you to follow the return process outlined above and then place a new order for the desired item.

Please note the following important points:

1. Shipping charges incurred during the initial purchase are non-refundable.
2. The customer is responsible for any return shipping costs, except in cases of damaged products.
3. We recommend using a trackable shipping method for returns to ensure safe and timely delivery.
4. Cobblo reserves the right to refuse a return or exchange if the product does not meet the specified conditions.
